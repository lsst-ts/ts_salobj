# Maximum value for the ``private_seqNum`` field of each topic,

# For command topics this field is the command ID, and it must be unique
# for each command in order to avoid collisions (since there is only one
# ``ackcmd`` topic that is shared by all commands).
# For other topics its use is unspecified but it may prove handy to
# increment it (with wraparound) for each data point.

class WriteTopic(BaseTopic):
    r"""Base class for topics that are output.

    This includes  controller events, controller telemetry, remote commands
    and ``cmdack`` writers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    salinfo : `.SalInfo`
        SAL component information
    name : `str`
        Topic name, without a "command\_" or "logevent\_" prefix.
    sal_prefix : `str`
        SAL topic prefix: one of "command\_", "logevent\_" or ""
    min_seq_num : `int` or `None`
        Minimum value for the ``private_seqNum`` field.
        If `None` then ``private_seqNum`` is not set; this is needed
        for the cmdack writer, which sets the field itself.
    max_seq_num : `int`
        Maximum value for ``private_seqNum``, inclusive.
        Ignored if ``min_seq_num`` is `None`.
    initial_seq_num : `int`, optional
        Initial sequence number; if `None` use min_seq_num.

    Attributes
    ----------
    isopen : `bool`
        Is this read topic open? `True` until `close` is called.
