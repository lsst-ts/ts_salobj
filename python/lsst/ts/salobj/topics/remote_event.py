    """Read a specific event topic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    salinfo : `SalInfo`
        SAL component information
    name : `str`
        Event topic name
    max_history : `int` (optional)
        Maximum number of historical items to read:

        * 0 if none; strongly recommended for `RemoteCommand` & `AckCmdReader`
        * 1 is recommended for events and telemetry
    queue_len : `int`
        Number of elements that can be queued for `get_oldest`.

    Notes
    -----
    All functions that return data return from an internal cache.
    This cached value is replaced by all read operations, so as long as
    no other code modifies the data, the returned data will not change.
