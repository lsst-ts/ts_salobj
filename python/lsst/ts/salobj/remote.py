class Remote:
    """A class that issues commands to a SAL component
    and receives telemetry and events from that component.

    If a SAL component listens to or commands other SAL components
    then it will have one Remote for each such component.

    Parameters
    ----------
    domain : `Domain`
        DDS Domain. If you have a `Controller` then use its ``domain``
        attribute. Otherwise create your own `Domain` and close it
        when you are done, for example::

            async with Domain() as domain:
                dome = Remote(domain=domain, name="ATDome", index=0)
    name : `str`
        Name of SAL component.
    index : `int` or `None`, optional
        SAL component index, or 0 or None if the component is not indexed.
        A value is required if the component is indexed.
    readonly : `bool`
        If True then do not provide commands.
    include : ``iterable`` of `str`, optional
        Names of topics (telemetry or events) to support,
        for example ["FilterChangeInPosition", "TrackingTarget"]
        If `None` then all are included except those in `exclude`.
    exclude : ``iterable`` of `str`, optional
        Names of topics (telemetry or events) to not support.
        Topic names must not have a ``tel_`` or ``evt_`` prefix.
        If `None` or empty then no topics are excluded.
    evt_max_history : `int`, optional
        Maximum number of historical items to read for events.
        Set to 0 if your remote is not interested in "late joiner" data.
    tel_max_history : `int`, optional
        Deprecated because historical telemetry data is no longer available.
        Must be 0 (or None, but please don't do that) if specified.
    start : `bool`, optional
        Automatically start the read loop when constructed?
        Normally this should be `True`, but if you are adding topics
        piecemeal after constructing the remote then specify `False`
        and call `start` manually after you have added all topics.
        Warning: if `False` then `self.start_task` will not exist
        and the remote cannot be used as an async context manager.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``include`` and ``exclude`` are both iterables
        (one or both must be `None`).

    Attributes
    ----------
    isopen : `bool`
        Is this instance open? `True` until `close` is called.
        The instance is fully closed when done_task is done.
    start_called : `bool`
        Has the start method been called?
        The instance is fully started when start_task is done.
    cmd_<command_name> : `topics.RemoteCommand`
        Remote command topic for each command supported by the component.
        Omitted if ``readonly`` true.
    evt_<event_name> : `topics.RemoteEvent`
        Remote event for each event supported by the component,
        as specified by ``include`` and the ``exclude`` arguments.
    tel_<telemetry_name> : `topics.RemoteTelemetry`
        Remote telemetry topic for each telemetry topic supported by the
        component, as specified by the ``include`` and ``exclude`` arguments.

    Notes
    -----

    Here is an example that makes a Test remote and displays
    the topic-related attributes::

        include salobj
        # the index is arbitrary, but a remote must use the same index
        # as the controller or CSC in order to communicate
        index = 5
        test_remote = salobj.Remote("Test", index)

        print(dir(test_remote))

    You should see the following topic-related attributes:

    * Commands, each an instance of `topics.RemoteCommand`:

        * ``cmd_standby``
        * ``cmd_start``
        * ... and so on for all other standard CSC commands
        * ``cmd_setArrays``
        * ``cmd_setScalars``

    * Events, each an instance of `topics.RemoteEvent`:

        * ``evt_appliedSettingsMatchStart``
        * ``evt_errorCode``
        * ... and so on for all other standard CSC log events
        * ``evt_arrays``
        * ``evt_scalars``

    * Telemetry, each an instance of `topics.RemoteTelemetry`:

        * ``tel_arrays``
        * ``tel_scalars``
